		<h1>The Individual</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>Name:</strong> Ted Ernest Bayer<br />

			<strong>Age:</strong> 32...ish<br />

			<strong>Profession:</strong> Mr. Bayer is a paper salesman for a small company,
			often bored by his job and looking for a little clean excitement to add to his
			often cluttered desk.<br/>

			<strong>Technology:</strong> Works from a low-end eMachine running Windows Vista,
			the same model as everyone else in his office. At home he has a budget PC build,
			accessing our site through Firefox. He doesn't use his Android phone much for
			accessing the web, due to data caps.<br />

			<strong> Attitudes and Behaviours:</strong> Ted is an opinionated single guy with
			a little disposable income who enjoys debating with his colleagues almost as much
			as he likes to keep up with the Kardashians. Both a political and social media
			information hound, he spends his time at work arguing with people online and taking
			BuzzFeed quizzes while attempting to engage his coworkers in friendly banter.<br />

			<strong> Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Ted is sick of people walking by his desk
			and not having anything to say to him; he hates having to initiate conversations...
			So Ted would like to put figurines, nay, <em>controversial</em> conversation starters
			on his desk...Not only for himself, but for the excitement of the whole office.<br />

			<strong>Goals:</strong> He needs to find a figurine that represents his views. He needs
			to find a figurine just right for that cute receptionist who seems to think he's funny.
			He needs whimsical gifts for his family and friends, and he wants them all in one place.

		<h1>The Admin</h1>
		<p>
			<strong>Name:</strong> Gregory Adobe<br />

			<strong>Age:</strong> 38<br />

			<strong>Profession:</strong> Facilities Coordinator for the New York Giants.<br/>

			<strong>Technology:</strong> Dell's at work, Mac's at home. Has iPhone and iPad with a shared
			10GB a month plan on Verizon's network.<br />

			<strong>Attitudes and Behaviours:</strong> Greg likes politics in general,
			but think's most people are silly for believing that anyone is what they
			say they are. The representatives are just that; a reflection of their constituancy.
			Of course they lie and flip-flop...people in his state do all the time. He is motivated
			to profit from the ignorance of people having opinions of these human shells (politicians).<br />

			<strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Greg needs an easy way to add images of mockups
			and prototype figurines etc to his Chinese-based supplier. He uses Google
			Trends to analyze the market or popularity of a political figure. He is
			frustrated that his site that he currently uses is so difficult to navigate
			and isn't even sure how to check if his customers have their orders in route
			or not.<br />

			<strong>Goals:</strong> To upload pictures of products, describe them, set
			and change prices, create sales on products that have backstock, and create
			and destroy categories and gift sets.

		<h1>The Bulk Buyer</h1>

			<p>
				<strong>Name:</strong> Emiliano Zapata<br />
				<strong>Age:</strong> 52<br />
			</p>
			<p>
				<h3><strong>Profession:</strong></h3>
				<article>
					Campaign Strategist for the Democratic National Committee whose delegates have tasked him
					with harnessing a new popular social symbol which millenials can really sink their teeth into
					and incorporate into their hip political-satire vlogs, thereby fostering greater party traction
					among future generations of voters whose primary news source is The Daily Show.
				</article>
				<h3><strong>Technology:</strong></h3>
				<article>
					Mr. Zapata enjoys the convenience of Apple services and accounts syncing across all of his devices,
					plus the Committee has provided its key members with official-use only 27-inch 5k retina desktop display iMacs.
					For personal use, and especially when roaming the country gaining campaign support, Mr. Zapata always carries
					his new 12-inch retina MacBook Pro, as well as his 4G-LTE unlimited data plan iPhone 6.
				</article>
				<h3><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong></h3>
				<article>
					Under constant pressure to deliver meaningful content to the committee, he’s always browsing popular social
					media sites for novel trends and media to utilize for his political strategies. He’s constantly perusing Facebook,
					LinkedIn, and Twitter for new material, and rarely spends more than ten seconds looking for inspiration on any given new post.
				</article>
				<h3><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong></h3>
				<article>
					Mr. Zapata needs a constant influx of inspiration and solid, family-friendly, often-humorous material to present
					to the party leaders. He needs to find novel and catchy symbols to grab a generation’s attention whose attention span
					is so short, it’s hardly measurable. He’s frustrated by the fleeting nature of his future constituents' political/social
					concerns, and wants to give them something that they can really relate to and which will solidify a positive association
					with the Democratic Party.
				</article>
				<h3><strong>Goals:</strong></h3>
				<article>
					Mr. Zapata has one goal- garner greater support for his party across the younger generations of Americans.
					To achieve this, he needs to speak to their cultural beliefs and institutions, which are often delivered satirically,
					especially when politics is the subject. How to reach a generation whose only unshakable belief in the political parties
					of the day, is that those parties will inevitably act so insensibly that the only serious commentary on their actions
					must resort to mockery...that is his primary question. This must include popular physical mediums, such as t-shirts
					and bumper stickers, and anything else that will deliver the message (such as a half-human, half-cyborg, Dick Cheney
					figurine holding a scale of justice weighted in favor of a money bag emblazoned with the logo of Halliburton against
					a peace sign). Also, discounted whole-sale orders of said figurine won’t hurt either.
